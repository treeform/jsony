This library has no dependencies other than the Nim standard library.

## About

Real world json is _never what you want_. It might have extra fields that you don't care about. It might have missing fields requiring default values. It might change or grow new fields at any moment. Json might use `camelCase` or `snake_case`. It might use inconsistent naming.

With this library you can use json your way, from the mess you get to the objects you want.

```nim
@[1, 2, 3].toJson() -> "[1,2,3]"
"[1,2,3]".fromJson(seq[int]) -> @[1, 2, 3]
```

## Fast.

Currently, the Nim standard module first parses or serializes json into JsonNodes and then turns the JsonNodes into your objects with the `to()` macro. This is slower and creates unnecessary work for the garbage collector. This library skips the JsonNodes and creates the objects you want directly.

Another speed up comes from not using `StringStream`. Stream has a function dispatch overhead because it has to be able to switch between `StringStream` or `FileStream` at runtime. Jsony skips the overhead and just directly reads or writes to memory buffers.

Another speed up comes from parsing and readings its own numbers directly from memory buffer. This allows it to bypass `string` allocations that `parseInt` or `$` create.

Note: If you find a faster nim json parser or serializer let me know!

## Can parse or serialize most types:

- numbers and strings
- seq and arrays
- objects and ref objects
- options
- enums
- tuples
- characters
- `HashTable`s and `OrderedTable`s
- `HashSet`s and `OrderedSet`s
- json nodes
- and `parseHook()` enables you to parse any type!

## Not strict.

Extra json fields are ignored and missing json fields keep their default values.

```nim
type Entry1 = object
  color: string
var s = """{"extra":"foo"}"""
var v = s.fromJson(Entry1)
doAssert v.color == ""
```

## Converts snake_case to camelCase.

Nim usually uses `camelCase` for its variables, while a bunch of json in the wild uses `snake_case`. This library will convert `snake_case` to `camelCase` for you when reading json.

```nim
type Entry4 = object
  colorBlend: string

var v = """{"colorBlend":"red"}""".fromJson(Entry4)
doAssert v.colorBlend == "red"

v = """{"color_blend":"red"}""".fromJson(Entry4)
doAssert v.colorBlend == "red"
```

## Has hooks.

Hooks are a powerful concept that allows you to parse json "your way" and is the main idea behind `jsony`!

- Note: that hooks need to be exported to where you are parsing the json so that the parsing system can pick them up.

### `proc newHook*()` Can be used to populate default values.

Sometimes the absence of a field means it should have a default value. Normally this would just be Nim's default value for the variable type but that isn't always what you want. With the newHook() you can initialize the object's defaults before the main parsing happens.

```nim
type
  Foo5 = object
    visible: string
    id: string
proc newHook*(foo: var Foo5) =
  # Populates the object before its fully deserialized.
  foo.visible = "yes"

var s = """{"id":"123"}"""
var v = s.fromJson(Foo5)
doAssert v.id == "123"
doAssert v.visible == "yes"
```

### `proc postHook*()` Can be used to run code after the object is fully parsed.

Sometimes we need run some code after the object is created. For example to set other values based on values that were set but are not part of the json data. Maybe to sanitize the object or convert older versions to new versions. Here I need to retain the original size as I will be messing with the object's regular size:

```nim
type Sizer = object
  size: int
  originalSize: int

proc postHook*(v: var Sizer) =
  v.originalSize = v.size

var sizer = """{"size":10}""".fromJson(Sizer)
doAssert sizer.size == 10
doAssert sizer.originalSize == 10
```

### `proc enumHook*()` Can be used to parse enums.

In the wild json enum names almost never match to Nim enum names which usually have a prefix. The `enumHook*()` allows you to rename the enums to your internal names.

```nim
type Color2 = enum
  c2Red
  c2Blue
  c2Green

proc enumHook*(v: string): Color2 =
  case v:
  of "RED": c2Red
  of "BLUE": c2Blue
  of "GREEN": c2Green
  else: c2Red

doAssert """ "RED" """.fromJson(Color2) == c2Red
doAssert """ "BLUE" """.fromJson(Color2) == c2Blue
doAssert """ "GREEN" """.fromJson(Color2) == c2Green
```

### `proc renameHook*()` Can be used to rename fields at run time.

In the wild json field names can be reserved words such as type, class, or array. With the `renameHook*()` you can rename fields to what you want.

```nim
type Node = ref object
  kind: string

proc renameHook*(v: var Node, fieldName: var string) =
  if fieldName == "type":
    fieldName = "kind"

var node = """{"type":"root"}""".fromJson(Node)
doAssert node.kind == "root"
```

### `proc parseHook*()` Can be used to do anything.

Json can't store dates, so they are usually stored as strings. You can use
`parseHook*()` to override default parsing and parse `DateTime` as a `string`:

```nim
import jsony, times

proc parseHook*(s: string, i: var int, v: var DateTime) =
  var str: string
  parseHook(s, i, str)
  v = parse(str, "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss")

var dt = """ "2020-01-01 00:00:00" """.fromJson(DateTime)
```

Sometimes json gives you an object of entries with their id as keys, but you might want it as a sequence with ids inside the objects. You can handle this and many other scenarios with `parseHook*()`:

```nim
type Entry = object
  id: string
  count: int
  filled: int

let data = """{
  "1": {"count":12, "filled": 11},
  "2": {"count":66, "filled": 0},
  "3": {"count":99, "filled": 99}
}"""

proc parseHook*(s: string, i: var int, v: var seq[Entry]) =
  var table: Table[string, Entry]
  parseHook(s, i, table)
  for k, entry in table.mpairs:
    entry.id = k
    v.add(entry)

let s = data.fromJson(seq[Entry])
```

Gives us:

```
@[
  (id: "1", count: 12, filled: 11),
  (id: "2", count: 66, filled: 0),
  (id: "3", count: 99, filled: 99)
]"""
```

### `proc dumpHook*()` Can be used to serialize into custom representation.

Just like reading custom data types you can also write data types with `dumpHook*()`.
The `dumpHook()` will receive the incomplete string representation of a given serialization (here `s`).
You will need to add the serialization of your data type (here `v`) to that string.

```nim
type Fraction = object
  numerator: int
  denominator: int

proc dumpHook*(s: var string, v: Fraction) =
  ## Output fraction type as a string "x/y".
  s.add '"'
  s.add $v.numerator
  s.add '/'
  s.add $v.denominator
  s.add '"'

var f = Fraction(numerator: 10, denominator: 13)
let s = f.toJson()
```

Gives us:

```
"10/13"
```

## Static writing with `toStaticJson`.

Sometimes you have some json, and you want to write it in a static way. There is a special function for that:

```nim
thing.toStaticJson()
```

Make sure `thing` is a `static` or a `const` value, and you will get a compile time string with your JSON.

## Full support for case variant objects.

Case variant objects like this are fully supported:

```nim
type RefNode = ref object
  case kind: NodeNumKind  # The ``kind`` field is the discriminator.
  of nkInt: intVal: int
  of nkFloat: floatVal: float
```

The discriminator does not have to come first, if they do come in the middle this library will scan the object, find the discriminator field, then rewind and parse the object normally.

## Full support for json-in-json.

Sometimes your json objects could contain arbitrary json structures,
maybe event user defined, that could only be walked as json nodes. This library allows you to parse json-in-json were you parse some of the structure as real nim objects but leave some parts of it as Json Nodes to be walked later with code:

```nim
import jsony, json

type Entry = object
  name: string
  data: JsonNode

"""
{
  "name":"json-in-json",
  "data":{
    "random-data":"here",
    "number":123,
    "number2":123.456,
    "array":[1,2,3],
    "active":true,
    "null":null
  }
}""".fromJson(Entry)
```

## Full support for raw-json.

Sometimes you don't need to parse the json, but just send it or store it in the database. You can speed this up by using `RawJson` type. What it does is prevents full parsing of that json tree and instead returns it is a `RawJson` (`distinct string`) type. You can then do anything you want with that. Store it in a database or pass it along to some other API. Or maybe parse it later again with jsony.

```nim
import jsony
type
  Message = object
    id: uint64
    data: RawJson

let
  messageData = """{"id":123,"data":{"page":"base64","arr":[1,2,3]}}"""
  message = messageData.fromJson(Message)

# make sure raw json was not parsed
doAssert message.data.string == """{"page":"base64","arr":[1,2,3]}"""

# make sure that dumping raw json produces same result
doAssert message.toJson() == messageData
```

You can also wait to parse the json later or maybe even with different types:

```
message.data.string.fromJson(DataPayload)
```
